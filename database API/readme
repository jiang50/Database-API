Our program read first 1000 records from business.json and user.json and corresponding reviews from review.json, then provies five functions and they are displayed on the screen. 
User can choose them by entering a number 1~5. The first one is to display user information by entering user name or user id (for example, lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg or Jeff, will return all Jeff's information). The second one is to 
display business information by entering business name or business id (for example Pho Huong). The third one is to filter business by entering city and the minimum
star(for example Las Vegas, 4). The fourth one is to display all the reviews for a business by entering the business name or id. The fifith one is to display some
summary about the data. We use most of the functionalities in the database API, including query, natural join, count. But we did not use cross join 
because it seems to be useless in this case. We also did not use max, min because they only return a string or number so we did not know 
the record it belongs to. We also used json.hpp to parse json file.
